## Exercise
### Make two changes using trunk based development

* Work in pairs - ___***sharing the same git repository***___
* Implement your own feature toggle
* One person implements Story 4 - After the first year
* One person implements Story 5 - Expensive vehicles after the first year
* Leave toggles off so that rules are not applied yet
  * Tests need to passâ€”turn the toggle on in your tests
* Turn the new features on one at a time

Notes:
See branch ```diesel_and_alternative_tax``` for a starting point to this exercise if they haven't completed the previous one.  
N.B. don't get them to checkout the branch (git weirdness will ensue), just get them to copy-paste the working code.  
There are already test suites for these stories they just need to be enabled so the build runs them.  
There is also an example solution on the ```subsequent_years``` branch.
