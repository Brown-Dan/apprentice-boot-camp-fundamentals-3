This project uses `node` version 10, and `nvm` (node version manager) to manage the version of `node`.

1. Make sure `nvm` is installed by running `nvm --version || brew install nvm`
2. Make sure you have the correct version of `node` by running `nvm install`.
3. Make sure you have all the required packages by running `npm install` (note the subtle difference between `nvm` in the previous step and `npm` here).

Now you can run the tests (against the right version of node) using `nvm exec npm test`.

Note: brew is not an officially supported installation method. If you have problems <sup>(e.g. [canâ€™t `nvm exec`](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/issues/856))</sup>, `brew uninstall nvm` follow [the official installation instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm/blob/master/README.md#installing-and-updating)
