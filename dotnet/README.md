From your terminal, change directory into `exercises\dotnet`. Run `code .` and Visual Studio Code should start opening the .NET code. If prompted, choose to download dependencies.

Validate that you are set up correctly by running the tests. Open one of the tests and you should see the option to `Run All Tests`. These should run okay, with all the tests being skipped (not failing). You should see output similar to this:

```text
Total tests: 14. Passed: 0. Failed: 0. Skipped: 14
```
